Assignment: ASSIGNMENT 1 # Name: Madden, Joseph
# Date: 2022-12-10
## Create a numeric vector with the values of 3, 2, 1 using the `c()` function ## Assign the value to a variable named `num_vector`
## Print the vector
num_vector <- c(3,2,1)
num_vector
## Create a character vector with the values of "three", "two", "one" "using the `c()` function ## Assign the value to a variable named `char_vector`
## Print the vector
char_vector <- c('three', 'two', 'one')
char_vector
## Create a vector called `week1_sleep` representing how many hours slept each night of the week ## Use the values 6.1, 8.8, 7.7, 6.4, 6.2, 6.9, 6.6
week1_sleep <- c(6.1, 8.8, 7.7, 6.4, 6.2, 6.9, 6.6)
## Display the amount of sleep on Tuesday of week 1 by selecting the variable index week1_sleep[3]
## Create a vector called `week1_sleep_weekdays` ## Assign the weekday values using indice slicing week1_sleep_weekdays <- week1_sleep[2:6]
## Add the total hours slept in week one using the `sum` function ## Assign the value to variable `total_sleep_week1` total_sleep_week1 <- sum(week1_sleep)
## Create a vector called `week2_sleep` representing how many hours slept each night of the week ## Use the values 7.1, 7.4, 7.9, 6.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.9
week2_sleep <- c(7.1, 7.4, 7.9, 6.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.9)
## Add the total hours slept in week two using the sum function ## Assign the value to variable `total_sleep_week2` total_sleep_week2 <- sum(week2_sleep)
## Determine if the total sleep in week 1 is less than week 2 by using the < operator total_sleep_week1 < total_sleep_week2
## Calculate the mean hours slept in week 1 using the `mean()` function mean(week1_sleep)
## Create a vector called `days` containing the days of the week.
## Start with Sunday and end with Saturday
days <- c('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday')
## Assign the names of each day to `week1_sleep` and `week2_sleep` using the `names` function and `days` vector names(week1_sleep) <- days
names(week2_sleep) <- days
## Display the amount of sleep on Tuesday of week 1 by selecting the variable name week1_sleep[3]
## Create vector called weekdays from the days vector weekdays <- days[2:6]
## Create vector called weekends containing Sunday and Saturday weekends <- c('Sunday', 'Saturday')
## Calculate the mean about sleep on weekdays for each week ## Assign the values to weekdays1_mean and weekdays2_mean weekdays1_mean <- mean(week1_sleep[weekdays]) weekdays2_mean <- mean(week2_sleep[weekdays])
## Using the weekdays1_mean and weekdays2_mean variables,
## see if weekdays1_mean is greater than weekdays2_mean using the `>` operator weekdays1_mean > weekdays2_mean
## Determine how many days in week 1 had over 8 hours of sleep using the `>` operator d = week1_sleep > 8
d
sum(d == TRUE)
## Create a matrix from the following three vectors student01 <- c(100.0, 87.1)
student02 <- c(77.2, 88.9)
student03 <- c(66.3, 87.9)
students_combined <- c(student01, student02, student03) grades <- matrix(students_combined, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
## Add a new student row with `rbind()` student04 <- c(95.2, 94.1)
grades <- rbind(grades, student04)
## Add a new assignment column with `cbind()` assignment04 <- c(92.1, 84.3, 75.1, 97.8) grades <- cbind(grades, assignment04)
## Add the following names to columns and rows using `rownames()` and `colnames()` assignments <- c("Assignment 1", "Assignment 2", "Assignment 3")
students <- c("Florinda Baird", "Jinny Foss", "Lou Purvis", "Nola Maloney")
